# stock_options_scraper
NYSE / NASDAQ stock scraper + CBOE options scraper

Output: https://github.com/melder/symbols_options_csvs

**Not a standalone repo** I uploaded to github for migration purposes.

But if you have a polygon.io key, plug it into settings.yml and run

```python tickers.py```

And it should be sufficient to grab all the symbols + options without all the extra crap
